# Data Analysis and Interpretation Specialization
###### by [Wesleyan University](https://www.wesleyan.edu/) | [Coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/)  
  
This is a repository of files that I have submitted for the fulfillment of courses under the [Data Analysis and Interpretation specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-analysis). I have been interested in Data Analysis and this specialization has been a good first step for me especially with their ways to approach it such as:
+ the blog posts as it helped me with my writing,
+ the code assignments as it made me retain everything that I have learned from the video lessons, and
+ the peer-reviews as it gave me feedback for code improvement.
  
:love_letter: I was able to take this specialization thanks to the Coursera grant offered by DOST-Caraga.
